A little match-up between tasks and music!!!!!!!
 

CalJam is a web application that integrates a daily activity tracker with music playlists from Spotify. It brings together two areas of everyday life: time management and music, by aligning user activities with curated playlists that complement the task at hand.  

The goal of CalJam is to make productivity more engaging and enjoyable. Users can plan their day through assignments and activities, while at the same time playing playlists that are tailored to each activity type. Whether studying, exercising, commuting, or relaxing, CalJam ensures that users remain both organized and motivated.
